## About Plagiarism-checker

Plagiarism-checker is a utility that checks if the given code is plagiarised from other sources on GitHub. This is done using the GitHub API.

### Idea
 
- The idea is to divide the code into smaller segments and search for each of them using the GitHub API and give a score to each segment.

- Fially using some algorithm, accumulate all scores of segment, and report how much plagiarised and the sources where the code can be found.

DWoC is a winter long program organised by [Delta Force](https://delta.nitt.edu/), the coding club of NIT Trichy. With an aim to support and improve the culture of open source software around us, this serves as a platform for young student developers (or even starters) to hone their technical skills by working on projects of their interests. We hope this encourages collabrative experiences and allows students from all backgrounds to contribute to quality technical projects from diverse fields.
